learning
========

Small collection of my various learning notes and exercises

* appway (java, uml)
* arduino (working example from years back)
* blog (jekyll based source markdown for www.bochenek.ch/blog)
* bookmarks (reads - not maintained since years)
* c (super fast compile and run)
* clojure (syntax tricks)
* coffeescript (basics only)
* cpp (time nano, fibonacci)
* d3 (diagrams and visualizations)
* dart (very basic)
* data_csv (used for machine learning or basic graphs)
* dont-break-the-chain
* go (all the hype these days)
* hadoop (getting started)
* html5
* infra (good for career / job security - more about running, then building)
* java (package-less ideal for run-on-save)
* julia (hello world)
* kdb (seems to have enough OSS + community)
* linux (syntax, configs, alias, etc.)
* nlp-jurafsky (natural language processing, questions, diagrams)
* old_python (syntax tricks for pre-version-3 python)
* opengl
* other (android)
* puzzles (thoughtworks 2004: programming, math, logic, etc).
* python (very different from python2 - syntax tricks)
* r (hello world)
* ruby (syntax tricks)
* rust (follow the trends...)
* scala (programming puzzles)
* scea (diagrams, pdfs)
* security (hearbeat demo from 2014)
* selenium (trivial tests...)
* smalltalk (because why not)
* solidity (working example - with npm)
* spark (samples)
* sql (queries from past projects)
* typescript (yet another language - may come useful)
* zig (only a few basic examples)
