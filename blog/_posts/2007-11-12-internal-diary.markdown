It’s amazing that I thought of this too:

> I think it’s time you put up a blog for internal use.

> Use a password if you like.

> Use it as an internal diary, a way of tracking each day so that a month or a year from now, you can look back at where you were and how you dealt with the issue of the day. Even if no one else on your team reads your blog, the act of creating it will be worthwhile.

> Perspective is worth a lot more than it costs.
