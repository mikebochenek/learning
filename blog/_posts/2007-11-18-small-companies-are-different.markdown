Small companies are more hectic. In a single day:

1. Thought we saw a DOS attack which might have been caused by something else (around 60K requests in 6 minutes from one IP address)
2. Fixed a configuration problem for one giant customer who was having intermittent expiring cookie problems.

Naren is worth his weight in gold :-)
