SuccessFactors just completed their IPO at the top of the range – $10 and the stock went up to $13 on the first day of trading.  The IPO celebrations made me realize that I party way too hard sometimes – I need to find other better ways of relieving my stress and enjoying myself.

I went to see Beowulf in a 3D Imax theater, it was pretty good. It was very motivating to see the just do it attitude of the main characters – very uplifting and very positive.

Strangely enough, my main take away from Mr. Magorium’s Wonder Emporium was that you have to believe in yourself and take risks.  The way kids do, without even thinking about it.

Two neat quotes from an external engineer:

* "Never discourage anyone…who continually makes progress, no matter how slow." - Plato
* "Almost anything you do will be insignificant.  But it is important that you do it." - Ghandi
