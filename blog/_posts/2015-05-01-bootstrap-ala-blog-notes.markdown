In the last few weeks, somehow I wanted to start writing these summaries or notes, which required nice formatting and table layouts:

* [Credit Suisse Pension Fun](http://bochenek.ch/protectedbyip/cs.html) - the first such note was motivated by me wanting to somehow see the CS Pension fund. 
* [Life - where had I lived and worked thus far](http://bochenek.ch/protectedbyip/life.html) - here I wanted to visualize where I had worked and lived, and who I am?
* [Spring 2015 list](http://bochenek.ch/spring.html) - todo list and time schedule for April 2015
* [Failures and unfinished ideas](http://bochenek.ch/failures.html) - a list which shows all the ideas that I had started to implement, and how most of them are unfinished
