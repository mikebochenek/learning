Isn't it better to write silly ideas, rather then no ideas at all?

## Anti-Alarm Excuses

- An app that generates various excuses for work / school
- Maybe it could be called "Anti-Alarm"
- It could integrate with email/whatsapp/etc.
- No clue how to make money on it

## Motivational Quotes

- An app that shows motivational quotes
- together with images?
- Maybe even push notifications.
- there must be tonnes of such apps already

## Chess Playback coach

- An app that replays famous chess games 
- AndroidTV?
- using an existing chess library
