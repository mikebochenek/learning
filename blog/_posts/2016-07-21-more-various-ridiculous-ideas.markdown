Yesterday I wrote on twitter: "coming up with seemingly ridiculous ideas is the only thing that differentiates us from the machines"

## Machine Learning Interviewing Guide

- cut and paste various topics from wikipedia, etc. into a book
- self-publish on amazon or make own website to get higher percentage of the revenue
- I'm not an expert on ML, but who cares...

## Writing, for the sake of writing

- start writing weird short stories for practice
- maybe write something on medium.com?

## workforequity.com

- A dating site for entrepreneurs without ideas or products, but who have some free time in their day job
- there are more people than you'd think that fall into that category

## Swiss TurboTax

- Javascript tax optimization tool for expats living in Switzerland
- Visualization with sliders etc based on user inputs
- Confidentiality would be very important
- Export / import to excel and PDF
- How would I monetize it though?

## ML or Data Science for Dummies

- An HTML visualization of common machine learning algorithms
- It would be cool, if you could simply upload and excel or csv and everything would be done for you automatically

## Message in a bottle

- A super simple web app to create a message in a bottle
- Which would send you your message in 1-5 years (and keep a history of it)
- As an aside, we could anonimize and publish in a book... :-) 

## Javascript keyboard

- Another technology idea was to create a little javascript library that would allow people to type the way that they would on a smart phone.  This was motivated by my own problem, when I thought about writing something in Polish, and realized that it was easier with my Sony Android because it was so clever about suggesting words that I might be thinking about.  I wonder if other non-native speakers have this same type of problem.
