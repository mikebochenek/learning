Here comes another batch of earth shattering ideas from September 2016.

## Digital Detox App

- An app that tracks and reports each time you unlock your phone, and helps you reduce your addiction by providing meaningful reports
- Maybe it could be offered together Swiss hut digital detox (a week long retreat where you have to give up your phone and internet access)

## Payments Over Chat Using Blockchain

- A Lync or jabber or Skype integration that let's you transfer payments easily over blockchain - maybe together with organizational change to focus on productivity 
- basically a blockchain based payment/rewards system for companies to motivate their employees

## Business Ideas Instead of Product Ideas 

- Business concept which starts with a payment for solving a problem, not with a product (or worse technology)
- Maybe I have been doing it all backwards (certainly seems like it when you explain it to non-techies)

## SSH Tunneling Made Easy

- On demand ssh tunneling for people who wanna browse Facebook behind corporate firewalls 
- You could even allow users to enable/disable via an App or web based admin GUI

## Lego Camps 

- Lego camps for kids locally (similar to chess camp)
- People here have money, and would not mind investing it in worthwhile education for their children

## Drone Garbage Pickup 

- Use Robotics for something that absolutely noone would want to do
- Surely this has been attempted before

## Mini Integrations

- Ask Swiss web shops, if they want me to integrate square into their online shop, to process credit card payments
- Ask anyone or any web store which has limited payment options (i.e. BrickLink)

## Kids Publishing For Parents

- What if I published the book that Luke dictated to me?
- What if other parents wanted to easily publish things like that?

## Free Antolin Checker App

- You are in a bookstore or library and you'd like to quickly check if that book is available on Antolin
- It would be fun to do, and could be good marketing for Switzerland

## Apache Spark Study Guide

- Write apache spark study guide for free MIT book
- It would be a great learning experience

## Performance Testing

- A GAE hosted application which does performance testing
- Similar to what Selenium is offering, but different somehow

## Push Motivational Quotes

- Push list of motivational quotes into an android app with push notifications daily
- Something like that would be very annoying, but then again, the self-improvement market is HUGE
