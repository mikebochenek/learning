Yet another batch of ideas that I have been thinking of recently...

## Javascript only LDAP client
- More than anything, it would be a cool chance to learn a bit more about LDAP and the space.

## For profit minecraft servers
- Seems to be open source and java based, and ripe for the picking.

## Workspace bragging site for developers and other creatives
- Visually describes what you have accomplished (descriptions not allowed; others can up/down vote)
- for example see [my workspaces]({{ site.url }}/blog/thoughts/2023/07/01/dev-workspace-screenshots/)

## Wifi disruptor
- which detects if you are getting distracted from you tasks (cuts Wifi as punishment)

## run on save extension
- I love [run on save](https://github.com/emeraldwalk/vscode-runonsave) for Visual Studio Code - [settings.json](https://github.com/mikebochenek/learning/blob/master/other/settings.json)
- might be cool to have counters or stats - on how often you save, and how often it runs successfully

By the way, if you find any of the above ideas cool (or if you turn one of them into a multi-million-dollar business - gasp!) you can thank me anonymously by sending bitcoin.
