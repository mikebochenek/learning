Instead of new random ideas, below are some fun memorable quotes from this year.

## Thinking to myself
- Real Canadians pour maple syrup into their tea, instead of honey or milk
- sometimes you just need a break or something different...
- Not always necessary to improve:  sometimes it's good enough - just celebrate, be happy & dance!

## Nicknames
- Long Island Mike
- Drazen & Deputies

## True conversation
- L: Can we have pasta on Sunday? (match day)
- M: Do you mean for dinner?  or lunch? 
- L: BREAKFAST.

## Motivation
- What we do in life, echoes in eternity
- Sometimes you climb out of bed in the morning and you think, I’m not going to make it, but you laugh inside – remembering all the times you’ve felt that way.
- I’m just an alcoholic who became a writer so that I would be able to stay in bed until noon. 

## Movies (back then they were better somehow)
- Footloose: overcoming things as a teenager
- Psycho: a classic horror movie
- New Spiderman
- Born on the 4th of July (Vietnam war)

## A few thoughts or ideas managed to sneak in as well
- I will probably have a different boss next year (promotion?)
- Ask chatGPT for some ideas, but use that to come up with others
- I have *three* very good books on AI / ML - I should really study them
- like pandas but for tree-structured data (i.e. XML or JSON)
- non-English chat gpt (polish, [german liaon](https://laion.ai/blog/leo-lm/))
- sending a future message to yourself (only I'd use something like "message in a bottle")
- Swiss property search webcrawler: including customizable scoring based on location, commute times, tax score, etc. 
- non-technical hacking of chat GPT: i.e. plant ideas (like inception movie) or maybe taking advantage of what chat GPT would recommend in the stock market (and doing opposite)
