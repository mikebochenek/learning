One of my colleagues always quotes Hillary Clinton: _never waste a good crisis_.  And my laptop rebuild started with a small crisis, because my Mac is not longer a viable option to citrix into my work environment (long story)

## The path less travelled
Below is what I had to do over the last two days to upgrade the laptop.
1. re-install _original_ harddisk which contained Windows 8.  I was hoping it would already have version 10 or at least 8.1, but alas, 

## List of installed applications
At first I wanted to keep the install very minimal, but I quickly got carried away, when I realized that the performance is actually half decent.
| software  | version   | comment  |
| --------- | --------- | -------- |
| java | 21 | not needed |

## Conclusion
It almost felt like a mini Christmas present for myself, because it somehow worked, and brought me joy :-)
