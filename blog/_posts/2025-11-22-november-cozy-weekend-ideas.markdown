Time to document another batch of ideas that I have been thinking this cozy weekend.

Friday I watched some [video(s)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BtHk-oNlN0) which focused on Samuel Rondot, an entrepreneur who *only* build products based on existing ideas.  He gets his ideas from online research and his mantra is to "build a proven idea" - i.e. twitter, buildinpublic,.   I guess as a european, the easy thing to do is to add localization.  I wonder how he outperforms the "copied" business (better marketing?).  There are more stories on [this channel](https://www.youtube.com/@starterstory).  Maybe that French optometrist was right in looking at other existing services, as his three products supposedly generate over 35000 / month

* [storyshort](https://storyshort.ai/) (based on autoshorts.ai)

## open source scan swiss qbill and convert 
- More than anything, I just want to know what kind of data is encoded in these QR-like codes

## gen-ai: generate recommendations texts
- Based on LinkedIn connections and profile, automatically generate texts and publish to recommendme.ch 

## gen-ai: conference participant voice bot 
- that I could personally use, to participate in calls and talk back AI splot (remember that one manager who always asked "whats the risk?")

## gen-ai: browser with veto button
- a browser with a veto button, where AI agents do your work, until you confirm/veto, with configurable speed
- so that you're just watching it do its thing: imagine overseeing a bot that search and applies for jobs on your behalf
    - Arindam's AI Bot (AAB) - A helper that solves a current problem for a concrete person

## robotics: stairmaster 2025
- a robot that helps old ladies carry groceries up the stairs (apartments without lifts!)

## rsvp.ch 
- like doodle with l8n and integrations for free (upsell to video calls, chats, and other oss)
- auto-close by date 
- blockchain incl. payments splitting or something 
- user customizable auto-scripting
- no sign-up required for organizer & participants

## personal improvements that I actually implemented
- less is more - no need to join events like 💡Fintech Spotlights, Global Events & New Partnerships
- move long term TODOs to a separate document
- tag emails which *require* action with highly visible tag
- daily github does not always have to be code: can also be markdown (blog ideas etc. or math)
