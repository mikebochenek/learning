I want to import a CSV file into cassandra. When I write this command on cassandra cqlsh, I got an error: command is:
COPY table ( ID,  name) FROM 'table.csv' WITH HEADER = TRUE;

use mykeyspace;

CREATE TABLE words (
  id int PRIMARY KEY,
  name text
);

COPY words (id, name) FROM 'test_v2.csv' WITH HEADER = TRUE;

DBeaver

use mykeyspace;
select * from users;
select * from words;

select count(*) from mykeyspace.users;

select id from mykeyspace.words;
select name from mykeyspace.words;

describe tables;

/* oh, I guess the problem is that it doesn't really show text fields, and
 * and error handling seems to be crap */
