Go
========

My experiments playground with Go (aka golang)

The best part of golang is that it's so fast and so simple.  Doing CONTROL+S reformats, saves, compiles, and runs all the test cases in 0.050 seconds!

Definition: Go is an open source programming environment that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.
