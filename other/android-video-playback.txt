Android phone only supports relatively few video formats (only 
supports H.263, H.264 AVC, MPEG-4 SP video format). 

So if you want to play AVI, Xvid, DivX, MKV, WMV, RM, FLV, SWF, ASF, 
MPG, MOV, MPEG, HD, MTS, M2TS, and TS on your Android phone like 
Samsung i7500, Samsung Galaxy, HTC Hero, HTC Legend, HTC Desire HD, 
HTC Wildfire, Motorola Droid, Motorola Flipout, Sony Ericsson Xperia 
X10, LG Ally and etc, you need to convert them to android phone 
compatible video format like mpeg-4

NiceJane is wrong. Using the MoboPlayer, I can play AVI, WMV, FLV, 
MPG, MOV, & MP4 files on my Android 2.2-based LG Optimus S, which 
only has a 600MHz ARM6 CPU and is far less powerful than the Galaxy. 
Android only natively supports these video file formats, but 
software developers are free to write software to decode whatever 
file format they like. You really just need good media player 
software. Try MoboPlayer or RockPlayer.

However, just because a particular format is supported by a media 
player, that doesn't mean that your phone has the horsepower to 
smoothly decode and display higher definition video files. For 
example, my lowly LG Optimus can play relatively low-resolution AVI 
files smoothly, but it can't smoothly play high-resolution AVI files.
