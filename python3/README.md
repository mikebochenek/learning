## What do we have here? 

A bunch of _truly_ random python scripts:  advent of code, project euler, machine learning + AI integrations, data visualization, etc.  

### Dependencies
* Usually requires common libs (maybe create a requirements.txt at some point?)
* Google API key

### Miscellenous 

Compile all with:
~~~
python3 -m compileall . -q -f
~~~
