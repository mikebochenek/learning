# Introduction
I cannot believe that I don't have a typescript folder yet!
see [typescript book](https://github.com/gibbok/typescript-book?tab=readme-ov-file#what-is-typescript)

# Setup

~~~
npm install typescript --save-dev
npx tsc

WARN engine typescript@5.9.3: wanted: {"node":">=14.17"} (current: {"node":"8.10.0","npm":"3.5.2"})

sudo npm install -g n
sudo n stable
