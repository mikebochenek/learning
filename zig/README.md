# Intro

Found myself a new toy: zig 

## install & learn

One can download an exe, but choco is more elegant (as admin)
```
choco install zig
```
Learning by cut and paste: https://ziglang.org/learn/overview/

## compiling c

And I can even compile some c code!
```
(base) C:\dev\code\learning\c>zig cc untitled1.c
```
(old university code needs some tweaks or maybe I'm doing it wrong)
